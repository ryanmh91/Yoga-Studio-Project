        <h3>Meditation Sessions</h3>
        <p> <strong>Visualization:</strong> This is a style of meditation where the practitioner focuses their attention on a positive image, thought, feeling, or sensation. 
            In this type of meditation, the practitioner will visualize an image or concept in their mind's eye, and remain focused on this image during the practice.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Chanting</strong> Chanting is a spiritual practice found in almost every culture, though it is most widely found in ancient Indian tradition. 
                It is the musical repetition of powerful sounds used to create vibrations throughout the body, calm the mind, and ultimately deepen the yogi's 
                (person who practices yoga) practice.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Restorative</strong> This practice utilizes breath and visualization to replenish depleted energy and fill your tank with enthusiasm and positivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Spiritual:</strong> What Is Spiritual Meditation? Spiritual meditation is an experience that takes you to the depths of who you are. You, as your real self, stripped of all the perceptions you had about yourself until that point in your life. In the process, you experience joy and peace. A feeling of love and light warms up your being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Mindfulness:</strong>Mindfulness meditation is a mental training practice that teaches you to slow down racing thoughts, let go of negativity, and calm both your mind and body. It combines meditation with the practice of mindfulness, which can be defined as a mental state that involves being fully focused on "the now" so you can acknowledge and accept your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment.
